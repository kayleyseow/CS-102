#### Examining Storage
- Computers have primary storage
  - It is also called memory
  - Primary storage is temporary or volatile
  - Everything happens in primary storage
  - Where is my program while it's running?
- Computers also have secondary storage
  - It is also called
  
#### A Deep Look into Storage
- All data is stored in bits
  - This is true, for memory, a CD or DVD, a flash drive, a 
  
#### Bytes â€” The Way We View Data
- A byte on a PC is made up of 8 bits
- A byte can hold a letter or a small number or any single character
  - Even a byte is too small for numbers in some cases
- A programmer thinks of storage as a long list of bytes
  - Think of it as an `array` of bytes
- Words
  - A word on a PC is made up of two bytes
- We will be more concerned with bytes more than words

#### File Types
- A file is data stored in secondary (permanent) storage
- There are two main types of files
  - Binary Files
    - Data files are one type of binary file
    - Program files are another (a.exe, any app)
    - If you look at these files with a text editor, you only see symbols
    - A better term would be a "non-text" file
    - Can be looked at with either the program that created it, or a program that can open binary files
  - Text files
    - You can look at these files with a text editor
    - A .cpp file is a text file

#### Working with Data
- We think of data as flowing in a stream
- This is like ducks in the children's pond game
- The ducks float around past a person
- The person can examine them as they come by
- Instead of saying "file", we will say "filestream"
  - The words are often used interchangeably

#### Using a File
- When you use a file, you have two choices
  - You can read the file (look at it)
    - This is also called input
  - You can write to the file (change it)
    - This is also called output
- We use file I/O to refer to file input and output
- In order to use a file, you have to
  - Open it before doing anything to it
  - Close it after you are finished with it

#### Opening a File Stream
- The `#include` for file I/O is `#include <fstream>`
- Opening a file stream allows you to use it
- You open a stream for reading by:
  ```cpp  
  ifstream data_file;
  data_file.open ("\\cs102\\programs\\lab8-1.dat");
  ```
  - You need to have `\\` because it is an escape character
- You now can read the data stored in the file
- Use `data_file` to refer to the file from now on

#### Reading the File
- Reading from a file is like reading from the keyboard using ```cin```
- Instead of `cin`, use the file variable
  ```cpp
  string a_line;
  data_file >> a_line;
  ```  
- To read several

#### Reading an Entire Line from a File
- Use the `getline()` function to read an entire line
  ```cpp  
  string input_line;
  getline(data_file, input_line);
  ```
- You can even use `getline()` to cause `cin` to read an entire line
  ```cpp  
  example
  ```

#### A Simple File Program: Echoing a File
An Example of File Echoing:
  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  #include <fstream>
  using namespace std;
  int main()
  {
    ifstream data_file;
    data_file.open ("\\cs102\\programs\\lab8-1.dat");
    string input_line;
    while (getline(data_file,input_line))
    {
    }
  }
  ```

#### An example to Process a File
- This is Program chap08/babynames.cpp from page 356
- Here is background information for the program
- There is a data file of 1000 records, each containing a boy's name and a girl's name
- The data was collected by the Social Security Administration

#### The Goal
- Looking through the list, someone noticed that there was a wider range of names given to girls than boys
- The person wondered if that were really true
- Or did it just seem to be true?
- If it was true, that would cause each girl's name to get a smaller percentage
- A program was written to test that idea

#### Implementation

#### Examining the Program
- Notice that the program uses the function pricess_name()
  - The function has a parameter that is a stream parameter
  - The stream parameter is a reference parameter (preceded by an `&`)
- You have to do this for any stream variable because it gets modified on a read or write
- Let's examine the program!
- babynames program:
  ```cpp
  // sec01/babynames.cpp
  #include <iostream>
  #include <fstream>
  #include <string>
  using namespace std;
  /**
  Reads name information, prints the name if total >= 0, and
  adjusts the total.
  @param in_file the input stream
  @param total the total percentage that should still be processed
  */
  void process_name(ifstream& in_file, double& total)
  {
    string name;
    int count;
    double percent;
    in_file >> name >> count >> percent;
    // Check for failure after each input
    if (in_file.fail())
    { 
      return;
    }
    if (total > 0)
    {
      cout << name << " ";
    }
    total = total - percent;
  }
  int main()
  {
    ifstream in_file;
    in_file.open("babynames.txt");
    // Check for failure after opening
    if (in_file.fail())
    {
      return 0;
    }
    double boy_total = 50;
    double girl_total = 50;
    while (boy_total > 0 || girl_total > 0)
    {
      int rank;
      in_file >> rank;
      if (in_file.fail()){
        return 0;
      }
    cout << rank << " ";
    process_name(in_file, boy_total);
    process_name(in_file, girl_total);
    cout << endl;
    }
    return 0;
  }
  ```

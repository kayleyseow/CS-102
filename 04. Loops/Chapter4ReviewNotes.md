#### Vocabulary to know
- Looping
- Iterate, iteration
- Hand tracing code
- Infinite loop
- Pre-Test, Post-Test loop  (Also, know which C++ loop is which kind)

#### Loop statements
- Know the syntax
- Be able to code a ```for```, ```while```, or ```do``` loop
- Be able to tell what’s computed or printed during or after a loop
- Know that a pre-test loop can be skipped entirely, but a post-test loop iterates at least once
- For extra credit, know the more versatile version of the ```for``` loop

#### The ```for``` loop
- The ```for``` loop is primarily for counting
- It is sometimes called a counter-controlled loop
- It can count up or down, and by any number

#### Scope of variables
- Know what we have discussed about scope:	
  - Variables are (only) visible in the block they are declared inside

#### The Character Type  (also ```string``` vs. ```char```)
- The character type can hold a single character
- A string can certainly do this, but it stores data in a different way
- The string is more wasteful for storing a single character
- The type is ```char```
- You use single quotes (like ' ) for ```char``` data, but double quotes (like ") for ```string``` data
- To get an individual character in a string, use [ ]

#### Shortcut Math Operators
- Be able to write a C++ calculation using them
- Be able to tell what is calculated by a line of C++ that uses them

#### Flow Charts
- Be able to draw a flow chart of a loop
- Most importantly, make sure your flow chart is made up (only) of structures

#### Typical applications of loops—Know them and the code
- Input validation
- [Calculating a Sum and Average](https://github.com/kayleyseow/cpp-problems/blob/master/04.%20Loops/Chapter4Notes2.md#applications-of-loops-1-calculating-a-sum-and-average)  
- [Counting Spaces in a String](https://github.com/kayleyseow/cpp-problems/blob/master/04.%20Loops/Chapter4Notes2.md#applications-of-loops-2-counting-spaces-in-a-string)  
- [Finding the First Match](https://github.com/kayleyseow/cpp-problems/blob/master/04.%20Loops/Chapter4Notes2.md#applications-of-loops-3-finding-the-first-match)   
- [Finding the Maximum and Minimum](https://github.com/kayleyseow/cpp-problems/blob/master/04.%20Loops/Chapter4Notes2.md#applications-of-loops-4-finding-the-maximum-and-minimum)

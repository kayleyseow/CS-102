## About
This repository has my complete coursework for the CS-102: Introduction to Computer Programming Using C++, including all of my notes, code, homework, and classwork. It is divided into 9 folders; 8 are for the different chapters that we covered in this class, and 1 is for material pertaining to the course final. Only my written code and responses in this repository belong to me; all the other materials are created by and belong to my instructor and the textbook. If you want to take a look at the semester project I worked on for this class with my group, Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, you may do so [here](https://github.com/kayleyseow/Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe).
